# Mini-Batch-Gradient-Descent-Quiz
In this quiz, you'll be given the following sample dataset (as in data_ml_raw2.csv), 
and your goal is to write a function that executes mini-batch gradient descent to find a best-fitting 
regression line. You might consider looking into numpy's matmul function for this!
